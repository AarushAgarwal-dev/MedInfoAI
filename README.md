## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────────┐
│         Frontend           │          │         Backend          │
│  React + Vite + Tailwind   │  HTTPS   │  Flask REST API + Groq   │
└────────────┬───────────────┘          └──────────┬───────────────┘
             │                                       │
             ▼                                       ▼
      User Browser                         External APIs (Groq, Google CSE)
```

- **Frontend** communicates with Flask via REST endpoints for data, and uses Leaflet for maps.  
- **Backend** orchestrates AI queries (Groq) and Google Custom Search, performs web-scraping for price data, and serves static HTML templates.  
- **Database**: Light-weight SQLite seed file for sample blog/articles; client-side `localStorage` for saved items.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **User interacts** with the React frontend (search, chat, compare, etc.).
2. **Frontend** sends API requests to the Flask backend for data, AI answers, or price info.
3. **Backend** processes requests, queries the SQLite DB, external APIs (Groq, Google), or scrapes pharmacy sites.
4. **Results** are returned to the frontend and displayed in a user-friendly UI.
5. **Saved items** are managed in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence.
